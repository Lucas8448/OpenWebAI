## Hosting OpenWebAi on Vercel using GitHub Actions

1. **Vercel Setup**:
    - **Create a Vercel Account**: Sign up for a Vercel account at vercel.com.
    - **Link GitHub Repository**: In the Vercel dashboard, link your GitHub repository that contains the OpenWebAi codebase. Vercel will automatically create a new project for your app.

2. **GitHub Actions Configuration**:
    - **Create GitHub Action Workflow**: In your GitHub repository, create a workflow file under `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
    - **Workflow File Content**:
      ```yaml
      name: Deploy to Vercel

      on:
        push:
          branches:
            - main

      jobs:
        deploy:
          runs-on: ubuntu-latest
          steps:
            - name: Checkout code
              uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Install Vercel CLI
              run: npm install -g vercel

            - name: Authenticate with Vercel
              run: vercel login --token ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}

            - name: Deploy to Vercel
              run: vercel --prod
              env:
                VERCEL_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.VERCEL_TOKEN }}
      ```
    - **Configure Secrets**: In your GitHub repository settings, add a secret named `VERCEL_TOKEN` with your Vercel API token. This token can be generated in the Vercel dashboard under the account settings.

## Configuring a CNAME Record through Vercel DNS

1. **Custom Domain Setup**:
    - **Add Domain in Vercel**: In the Vercel dashboard, navigate to the Domains section and add your custom domain.
    - **Configure CNAME Record**: Once the domain is added, Vercel will provide DNS records to configure. Add a CNAME record in your domain registrar’s DNS settings pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`.
    - **Verify Domain**: Return to the Vercel dashboard and verify that the domain has been correctly configured.

## Access Management Setup

1. **Authentication with Auth0**:
    - **Create Auth0 Application**: In the Auth0 dashboard, create a new application and configure it with the appropriate callback URLs for your Vercel deployment.
    - **Integrate Auth0 in OpenWebAi**: Update your application code to use Auth0 for user authentication. This typically involves setting up Auth0 SDK and configuring authentication routes.
  
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:
    - **Define Roles**: In Auth0, define roles for different user types (e.g., admin, user).
    - **Assign Roles**: Assign roles to users based on their responsibilities.
    - **Implement RBAC in Application**: Use Auth0’s RBAC features in your application code to restrict access to certain parts of your application based on user roles.

3. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**:
    - **Enable MFA in Auth0**: In the Auth0 dashboard, enable MFA for added security.
    - **Configure MFA Policies**: Configure policies for when MFA should be prompted (e.g., on every login, only for admins)
